These are my first three projects that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All of them take advantage of basic front-end development concepts such as conditional logic, DOM manipulation, CSS styling, HTML structuring, and the use of IDs and classes in HTML.

The first project, "Guess My Number," is a JavaScript-based game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. After each guess, the game provides hints in the form of "Too Low" or "Too High," depending on the player's input. For every incorrect guess, the player loses one point from their total score, which starts at 20. If the score reaches 0 and the number has not been guessed correctly, the player loses the game. On the other hand, if the player guesses the number correctly, they win. Additionally, a high score system is in place, allowing the player to challenge their previous best by making more strategic guesses.
