# Modal-Window

These are my first three projects that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All of them take advantage of basic front-end development concepts such as conditional logic, DOM manipulation, CSS styling, HTML structuring, and the use of IDs and classes in HTML.

The first project is a guess my number game where a player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides hints to the player after every guess in the form of (Too low or Too High) depending on the players' guess.
